# i3gaps
# Works great with Debian Stable
I wanted to install i3 gaps on debian stable.
My recommendation is to install debian stable minimal (no gui).
I used the expert method.

```
sudo apt install git

git clone https://github.com/drewgrif/i3gaps-debian

cd i3gaps-debian

chmod +x install.sh

./install.sh

sudo reboot
```

log in using ly log in manager.
